                        wizard, the player runs through a 2D landscape and defeats monsters along the way.
                        This game is a simple 2D Run n’ Gun much like other games in the genre. However, it allows for
                        shooting in the four cardinal directions (up, down,left, and right) which is completely
                        independent from movement and player position.

                    There was a land of fantasy called Obvioulous where a duo of Heros, the Paladin and the Wizard,
                    ventured to defeat the immortal
                    Demon Lord that maintained a tyrannical grip over the denizens of the country in hopes to attain
                    glory and riches. After a long and weary adventure, they arrived at the
                    entrance of the Demon Lord's lair. After venturing inside, they had an intense and fierce battle
                    against the Demon Lord and the duo brought him to his knees. Knowing it was
                    impossible to kill him, they prepared a magic crystal to seal him away. However, at the last moment,
                    the Paladin trapped the Wizard inside the crystal along with the Demon Lord!
                    The "noble" knight had wanted the glory all to himself. Trapped inside the crystal with the Demon
                    Lord, the Wizard's hatred towards his former friend grew.
                    The Wizard made a pact with the Demon Lord, fusing with them and granting them abilities that will
                    allow them to defeat their former friend.
                    After centuries of being trapped within the crystal, a couple of newbie adventurers stumbled on the
                    ruins of where the Wizard and Demon Lord were sealed.
                    Unwittingly breaking the seal that held them in the crystal for so long. Centuries having passed
                    however, the Wizard realizes their friend was long gone so instead
                    he swore vengeance against their entire lineage and legacy. As such, Wizard/Demon Lord fusion set
                    out to defeat the Paladin's descendant residing in luxury at the
                    Obvious Palace.

                        The Wizard can shoot fireballs in multiple directions in order to defeat enemies.
                        Pressing the arrow keys allows the player to shoot in 8 possible directions.
                        For example, pressing two arrow keys simultaneously allows for diagonal shooting.
