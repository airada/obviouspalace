            <div class="row text-center">
                Crystal Crisis is a fantasy themed Run and Gun. Playing as a wizard, the player runs through a 2D landscape and defeats monsters along the way.
                This game is a simple 2D Run n’ Gun much like other games in the genre. However, it allows for shooting in the four cardinal directions (up, down,left, and right) which is completely independent from movement and player position.

                <h4>Narrative</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="row text-center">
                There was a land of fantasy called Obvioulous where a duo of Heros, the Paladin and the Wizard, ventured to defeat the immortal
                Demon Lord that maintained a tyrannical grip over the denizens of the country in hopes to attain glory and riches. After a long and  weary adventure, they arrived at the
                entrance of the Demon Lord's lair. After venturing inside, they had an intense and fierce battle against the Demon Lord and the duo brought him to his knees. Knowing it was
                impossible to kill him, they prepared a magic crystal to seal him away. However, at the last moment, the Paladin trapped the Wizard inside the crystal along with the Demon Lord!
                The "noble" knight had wanted the glory all to himself. Trapped inside the crystal with the Demon Lord, the Wizard's hatred towards his former friend grew.
                The Wizard made a pact with the Demon Lord, fusing with them and granting them abilities that will allow them to defeat their former friend.
                After centuries of being trapped within the crystal, a couple of newbie adventurers stumbled on the ruins of where the Wizard and Demon Lord were sealed.
                Unwittingly breaking the seal that held them in the crystal for so long. Centuries having passed however, the Wizard realizes their friend was long gone so instead
                he swore vengeance against their entire lineage and legacy. As such, Wizard/Demon Lord fusion set out to defeat the Paladin's descendant residing in luxury at the
                Obvious Palace.
